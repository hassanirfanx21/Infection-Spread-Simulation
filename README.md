# Infection Spread Simulation

A simulation tool to model the spread of infections in a population.

## Overview

This project simulates how infections spread through populations using various algorithms and models. The simulation can be configured to show different scenarios based on parameters like infection rate, recovery time, population density, and containment measures.

## Features

- Visual representation of infection spread
- Configurable simulation parameters
- Statistical analysis of outcomes
- Multiple infection models

## Installation

Instructions on how to set up and run the simulation.

## Usage

Examples of how to use the simulation tool and interpret results.
